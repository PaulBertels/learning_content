# Goals

## A social robot...

Social robots are robots specifically designed to communicate with humans and participate in social interactions. The ultimate goal is to create a social robot where the interaction between human and machine is as natural as possible.

When designing a social robot, it is important not only to focus on the efficiency of the robot in performing its tasks, but also on the social and emotional aspects of the interaction between the robot and humans. This requires knowledge of various domains such as technology, human behavior, and design. Social robotics, therefore, requires an interdisciplinary approach due to the complex interaction between the robot, its environment, and the people who come into contact with it.

"The students have full control over the design of their social robot. They are the architects of their own creation and have the opportunity to express their unique vision and personal style in the design. This allows them to develop their technical and creative skills and a sense of pride in building a robot that is fully based on their own ideas and insights.

Using reusable materials, crafting supplies, and electronic components, the students have the opportunity to build their robot from scratch. Through this approach, they can not only develop their technical skills but also hone their creative and problem-solving abilities."

### Designing

The students have complete control over the design of their social robot. They are the architects of their own creation and have the opportunity to express their unique vision and personal style in the design. This enables them to develop their technical and creative skills and a sense of pride in building a robot based entirely on their own ideas and insights.

Using reusable materials, craft supplies, and electronic components, the students have the opportunity to build their robot from scratch. This approach not only allows them to develop their technical skills but also sharpens their creative and problem-solving skills.

### Programming

To introduce students to the principles of programming in an accessible way, this project uses the Dwengo simulator. This simulator is designed for beginners who are looking for their first (graphical, block-based) programming experience. This foundation can help them transition to textual programming languages in the future.

When programming the social robot, students refine their computational thinking skills and gain insight into how the robot functions and responds to the environment. By writing code and testing the functionality of the robot, they can improve their problem-solving skills, among other things.

### Building

As the final component of the project, the students are required to convert their virtual robot into physical reality.

The students are provided with reusable materials and a microcontroller platform to build their robot. They must consider the materials they want to use and how they can combine these materials to construct the robot. It is also important for them to consider the functionality and design of the robot they have conceived in the previous modules.

The building process offers a wide range of possibilities that require a variety of skills. It is therefore an ideal opportunity to integrate the subjects of technology and art into the project.
