# Goals

## A social robot...

Social robots are robots specifically designed to communicate with humans and engage in social interactions. The ultimate goal is to create a social robot where the interaction between human and machine is as natural as possible.

When designing a social robot, it is important to focus not only on the efficiency of the robot in performing its tasks, but also on the social and emotional aspects of the interaction between the robot and the human. This requires knowledge from different fields such as engineering, human behavior, and design. Social robotics, therefore, requires an interdisciplinary approach because of the complex interaction between the robot, its environment, and the people who come into contact with it.

### Designing

The students have complete control over the design of their social robot. They are the architects of their own creation and have the opportunity to express their unique vision and personal style in the design. This allows them to develop their technical and creative skills and a sense of pride in building a robot that is based entirely on their own ideas and insights.

Using reusable materials, craft supplies, and electronic components, the students have the opportunity to build their robot from scratch. This approach allows them not only to develop their technical skills but also to sharpen their creative and problem-solving skills.

### Programming

To introduce students to the principles of programming in an accessible way, this project uses the Dwengo simulator. This simulator is designed for beginners looking for their first (graphical, block-based) programming experience. This foundation can help them transition to textual programming languages in the future.

Programming the social robot sharpens the students' computational thinking and gives them insight into how the robot functions and responds to its environment. By writing code and testing the functionality of the robot, they can improve their problem-solving skills.

### Building

As the final part of the project, students must translate their virtual robot into physical reality.

The students are provided with reusable materials and a microcontroller platform to build their robot. They must think about the materials they want to use and how they can combine these materials to construct the robot. It is also important that they consider the functionality and design of the robot they created in the previous modules.

The construction process offers a wide range of possibilities that require a variety of skills. It is, therefore, an ideal opportunity to integrate the subjects of engineering and design into the project.
